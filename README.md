## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.46+

## How to Use
There are three ways to open a file as hex
1. Trigger the command palette (Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P) -> Reopen With -> Hex Editor
2. Right click a file -> Open With -> Hex Editor
3. Trigger the command palette (Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P) -> Open File using Hex Editor

If you would like to use the hex editor as the default hex editor for certain file types you can add the `workbench.editorAssociations` setting to your `settings.json`.

For example, this would associate all files with .hex or .ini to open by default in the hex editor
```json
    "workbench.editorAssociations": [
        {
            "viewType": "hexEditor.hexedit",
            "filenamePattern": "*.hex"
        },
        {
            "viewType": "hexEditor.hexedit",
            "filenamePattern": "*.ini"
        }
    ],
```
