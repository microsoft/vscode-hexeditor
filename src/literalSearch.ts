/**
 * A simple literal search implementation with support for placeholders. I've
 * attempted to use or adapt several string search algorithms for use here,
 * such as Boyer-Moore and a DFA approach, but was not able to find one that
 * worked with placeholders.
 *
 * A DFA can work with wildcards easily enough, and an implementation of that
 * can be found in commit 5bcc7b4e, but I don't think placeholders can be
 * efficiently encoded into the DFA in that approach. Eventually that just
 * becomes a regex engine...
 *
 * Note that streamsearch (connor4312/streamsearch) is 70% faster than this,
 * but doesn't have support for the equivalency table or placeholders. We could
 * add a happy path that uses that library if no placeholders are present, but
 * I've opted for simplicity for the moment. This operates at
 * around 50 MB/s on my macbook.
